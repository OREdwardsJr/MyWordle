# MyWordle
A Python based game similar to Wordle, which features a TKinter GUI

This is a functioning app that is similar to the popular game Wordle. It provides a GUI via TKinter. 

The user gets 6 chances to guess what the hidden word is. If the user's guess matches the index and a character of the hidden word then the square turns blue and subsequently locks. If the user chooses a letter within the hidden word, but at the wrong index, the letter highlights yellow and it is up to the user to decide where that letter should fit.

This version of the program is going to be utilized as a tutorial that will be created. A higher-level version of the app will be created and updated into the repo once it's completed.
